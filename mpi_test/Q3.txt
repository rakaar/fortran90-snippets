Initially the size of MPI_Comm_World was kept to be same as number of process
On running the program with 8 process
The average time was around 8 x 10^(-4)
(Different processes exit at differnt times, here maximum time is defined as 
the maxium of all time period of all the processes)

On reducing the size of MPI_Comm_World to its half(size of MPI_Comm_World is nproc/2),
The maxium time taken by a process was around 4 x 10^(-4)

Hence we observe the average time is expected to reduce with size of MPI_Comm_World
This is expected because Now the program has to wait for less number of process to sync

Caveat
However it is difficult to come to a conclusion that is linearly decreasing because
none of the process were doing anything and hence if u try to furthur reduce the difference in cpu_time
cannot give a proper idea of relationship
