The code has been tested with message array of integers of the following sizes
and the finish times have been noted

size  finish_time_of_rank0 finish_time_of_rank1
4        1.21139996E-02    1.19689964E-02
40        1.43340006E-02  1.43780001E-02
100      1.84300020E-02  1.84419975E-02
200   2.16549970E-02   2.17889994E-02
500  3.09110023E-02  3.09270024E-02
1000 4.51990031E-02  4.52089980E-02


it is clear from the above data that the time period increases
as the message size increases. This is expected because larger data 
needs to be transmitted from one process to another as size of message increases.
